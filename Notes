Capitaliztion is important in programing 
EX: From random Import randint 
*Due to the fact the 'F' in from and 'I' in import are capitalized
the fuctions do not work.
Should be as such: from random import randint

Ex: list1=["Rock", "Paper" , "Scissors"]
*In Python, the sequence of various data types is stored in a list.
A list is a collection of different kinds of (,) and the square brackets [enclose the List's items] serve as separators.

Ex: 
computer = list1[randint(0,2)]
Player = False 

*randint() method returns an integer number selected element from the specified range.
Note: My understanding is that the computer equals list1 which data types include Rock,Paper,and Scissors.
Player is 

EX:
While player == False:
    player = input("Rock, Paper, Scissors?")
    if player == computer:
        print("Tie!")
*If player and computer select the same value it = to a tie
the if statement is how you perform this sort of decision-making.
It allows for conditional execution of a statement or group of statements based on the value of an expression.
